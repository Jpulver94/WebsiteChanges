<!-- note
Before printing labels, use your browser's print preview options to set the top print margin to 1/2 inch and all other print margins to 0 (zero).
Try printing a test page on plain paper first. Hold it up to the light behind a sheet of labels to make sure the bar codes line up with the stickers.
